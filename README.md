# IMTC505_Lab2Assignment
 
For this assignment, my theme was simply being in a forest and trying to mimic actions that can happen there. So, my 3 interactions are:
1. Being able to grab & throw any rocks in the scene.
2. Teleportation using ray-casting to any tree in the scene.
3. Being able to switch between day & night using a button by manipulating the skybox. 

For this assignment I used two assets from the Unity store: StarSkybox and SimpleNaturePack.
